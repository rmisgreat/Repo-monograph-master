II. SIX-PHASE PRODUCTION CYCLE					
Phase	Role	Model	Primary Task	Output Artifact	Decision Gate
1	Architect	ChatGPT (GPT-5)	Expand outline into structural blueprint and causal scaffolding.	Structural Blueprint	Gate 1: Approve structural plan (Y/N)
2	Author	Gemini	Generate first full prose draft with equations, causal derivations, and multi-layer explanations.	v1.0 Draft	Gate 2: Approve technical completeness (Y/N)
3	Pedagogue	ChatGPT (GPT-5)	Refine tone, improve readability, and add child-level explanatory summaries.	v1.1 Draft (Stylistic)	—
4	Technician	DeepSeek	Audit 1/2: Verify mathematical and physical self-consistency of all derivations.	Error Log (line-specific math/physics corrections)	—
5	Researcher	Perplexity	Audit 2/2: Empirical fact-checking, citation verification, update cosmological or physical parameters.	Data Log (new data + BibTeX entries)	Gate 3: Collate logs for integration
6a	Integrator	Gemini	Apply all corrections from Phase 4 & 5 logs into v1.1 draft.	v1.9 Draft (technically complete)	—
6b	Synthesizer	ChatGPT (GPT-5)	Final stylistic and conceptual polish ensuring coherence of the integrated text.	v2.0 Master Draft (publishable)	Gate 4: Final approval & archive

IV. METRICS LAYER — QUALITY & INTEGRITY CRITERIA					
Phase	Metric	Target Threshold	Validation Method		
1 (Architect)	Structural Coherence Score	≥ 0.90	PI structural audit		
2 (Author)	Equation Completeness Ratio	100 %	Cross-check with section spec		
3 (Pedagogue)	Readability (Flesch–Kincaid)	≤ 14.0	Automated readability test		
4 (Technician)	Equation Error Rate	≤ 1 per 1,000 words	DeepSeek audit log		
5 (Researcher)	Citation Validation Rate	100 %	BibTeX + DOI verification		
6 (Synthesizer)	Style Consistency Index	≥ 0.95	NLP style alignment test		
V. FAILOVER & CONTINUITY PROTOCOL					
Model Role	Primary	Secondary (Failover)	Fallback Method		
Architect	ChatGPT (GPT-5)	Claude 3.5 Sonnet	Auto-switch via API		
Author	Gemini	GPT-5 (Author Mode)	Manual assignment		
Pedagogue	ChatGPT (GPT-5)	Claude 3 Opus	Substitute narrative pass		
Technician	DeepSeek	MathGPT	Equation validation		
Researcher	Perplexity	Elicit / Scite	Empirical audit		
Integrator	Gemini	Claude 3.5	Manual merge		
Synthesizer	ChatGPT (GPT-5)	Gemini	Final polish		
					
Continuity Rule: If primary model unavailable > 48 hours, failover triggers automatically. All substitutions logged in Revision Ledger.					
					
VI. DATA INTEGRITY CHAIN					
					
Every Data Log (Phase 5) must include:					
					
✅ DOI or official URL for every empirical source					
📅 Date of last verification					
🔁 Revalidation Due (90-day interval)					
🧮 Cross-citation consistency index (≥ 0.95)					
🔐 SHA-256 checksum of log file					
					
All verified data is appended to a central “Empirical Database Ledger” for future cross-section consistency passes.					
					
VII. VISUALS PIPELINE PROTOCOL					
Step	Description	Responsible Model			
Prompt Specification	Generate figure or diagram prompts (e.g., “Figure I-A.6: n_s vs r plane”).	ChatGPT			
Image Generation	Use DALL·E 3 / Midjourney / Stable Diffusion	External image model			
Validation	Compare visual accuracy vs. data and caption.	Gemini			
Metadata Embedding	Embed figure DOI, caption, and revision hash.	Perplexity			
VIII. CONSISTENCY PASS (OPTIONAL LOOP A)					
					
Run after every 3–4 sections to ensure global coherence.					
					
[CONSISTENCY PASS]					
├── Verify variable uniformity (M_P vs m_pl)					
├── Check global constants (Ω_Λ, H₀, η_b)					
"├── Harmonize terminology (""inflaton"" vs ""scalar driver"")"					
├── Cross-reference data from Empirical Database Ledger					
└── Update Section Index Map					
IX. STYLE HARMONIZATION (OPTIONAL LOOP B)					
					
Performed at milestone intervals to ensure stylistic unity.					
					
Aspect	Reference Guide	Target Metric			
Tone	Master Style Guide (v1.0)	Consistency Index ≥ 0.95			
Terminology	Lexicon Standard File	Zero conflicts			
Formatting	Markdown ISO Template	Full compliance			
X. FINAL STAGE AND ARCHIVAL PROTOCOL					
Step	Artifact	Repository	Notes		
Final Approval	v2.0 Master Draft	PI Validation Folder	“Approved” tag issued		
Backup Clone	v2.0 Master + Figures	Git / Drive	Weekly mirror		
Public Release	PDF / HTML	Journal or Archive.org	DOI assigned		
Audit Retention	All Logs + Hashes	Local Cold Storage (5 years)	Immutable record
