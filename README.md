# Multi-Agent Research Monograph Project

Welcome to the **Multi-Agent Research Monograph** repository. This project implements a precision research workflow with long-term traceability, empirical audit compliance, and multi-model collaboration as outlined in the Operational Charter (v2.2).

## Workflow Overview

- Six-phase production cycle (Architect → Author → Pedagogue → Technician → Researcher → Integrator/Synthesizer)
- Rigorous versioning, traceability, and audit mechanisms
- Automated and human validation at each stage
- Backups and offsite replication

## Directory Structure

- `charter/` — Operational Charter and governance
- `revision-ledger/` — Revision logs and integrity checks
- `empirical-database/` — Empirical data and citation ledger
- `outputs/` — Drafts, blueprints, and master files
- `logs/` — Error, audit, and data logs
- `templates/` — Output and log templates for all phases

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repo and review the Operational Charter:**  
   `charter/OPERATIONAL_CHARTER_v2.2.md`

2. **Follow the production cycle:**  
   Use the templates in `templates/` to create outputs for each phase.

3. **Log all changes:**  
   Update `revision-ledger/REVISION_LEDGER.md` for every significant edit. Generate SHA-256 checksums for artifacts.

4. **Backup frequently:**  
   Use the provided GitHub Actions workflow for weekly backups.
